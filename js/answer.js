// Answer the Following
// For each of the following, write which datatypes you would use to represent the data, and then give a small example of the data structure:

// // A light switch that can be either on or off.
// Boolean, because it can be true or false

// // A user's email address.
// a string so the user can save all of their information without causing any conflics.

// A spaceship with a hull, laser blasters, tractor beam, and warp drive.
//object so that the properties of the ship can be saved.

// A list of student names from our class.
// array because it's a series of strings.

// A list of student names from our class, each with a location.
//an object or a nested array because the location information can be saved as a key and value in an object, but since it's not a lot of detail, it could be stored as a nested array for each individual. [Patrick, Denver][Donnatello, NYC]

// A list of student names from our class, each with a location and each with a list of favorite tv shows. 
// an object would be ideal because each student could be stored along with their location  and tv shows easily.
